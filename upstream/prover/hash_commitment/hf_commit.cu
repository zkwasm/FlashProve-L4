// cp_commit, the committer, on the GPU. From the weights, the configuration (policy.txt, KL.bin,
// layout.txt), the number of leaf tables (-M; `copy` in identifiers) and one seed it generates a
// commitment: `ivk`, the public key directory, and `isk`, the secret one. The command line and its
// usage text are in prover/weights_commitment/arguments.h. Nothing is proved about these programs.
//
// A weight table T is all the weights as a matrix of long rows, each with random masks, encoded,
// under one Merkle tree. The anchor (`first_table` in identifiers) is a commitment's first weight
// table. Leaf table k (not a tree leaf) is a further table of the same weights with its own masks.
// The parameter file is policy.txt. The key file, ivk/key.bin, has the anchor's root and the
// committer's one-time proofs about it. The leaf file ivk/leaf/<k>.bin has leaf table k's root and
// its LINK proof, meant to show that the table holds the anchor's weights. Identifiers and messages
// say "entry" for a leaf file, "link" for a LINK proof, "coins" for private randomness, "draw" for
// sample, "make" for generate, "walk" for a pass over the weights, "judge" for the verifier program
// cp_verify, "refuse" for reject, "asked" for requested, `made_up` for synthetic, `_door` for test
// code or hook, "folder" for directory, "serving build" for production build, `published_id` for
// commitment ID. A tag in square brackets is the name that a check's message prints; only
// [keep-for-the-audit] is printed by none: it marks the code for that option.
// Three phases of work:
//   A  A table's Merkle tree (prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_table.cuh). In comments M is W, the
//      matrix of all weights, as R long rows. Each row gets its masks from the table's key and is
//      encoded to length 2^fln. A column of T, one symbol of each row, is one tree leaf. T is never
//      stored. The tree's levels from s (-keep) up stay in memory, and level s is written as
//      hcnodes.bin. A root depends only on the weights, the table's key and the configuration.
//      A table has a record: stored answers to samples of its rows. Phase A ends with one more
//      pass over the weights, which computes the answers (make_the_record()): the sample points are
//      derived from the root. The anchor's answers go into the key file, a leaf table's into its
//      leaf file.
//   B  The key file (prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_once.cuh): the range proof on all cells (M's
//      entries, signed bytes) and weights, and the one-time test on the anchor.
//   L  A leaf file (prover/hash_commitment/hf_entry_make.cuh): the leaf table's LINK proof.
// B and L run the library's code: blk::make_key() (blocks/frame/check_key.h), blk::make_entry()
// (blocks/frame/check_entry.h). Both take a blk::Configured, which the verifier's own code builds
// before a weight is read (verifier/src/cp_configured.h). Formats: docs/format/FORMAT.md.
//
// The first form of the call (with -weights) generates a commitment. It loads the weights once,
// into page-locked host memory, and checks them: the checksums of wsums.txt, the declared ranges,
// the worst case (below). Only then does it sample the seed or, with -public-weights, derive it: a
// run that fails a check has sampled nothing. It works in <isk>.making and <ivk>.making
// (prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_making.h), renamed at the end; a run that fails or is ended by
// SIGABRT, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP or SIGPIPE removes them name by name: only the names that it
// created itself. If somebody else has put a file of another name into one, that file and the
// directory stay, and a message says so. After SIGKILL, any other signal, a crash or a power
// failure both directories stay, and no call removes them: the same call, repeated, is rejected
// and says what is left. In order:
//   the anchor         phases A and B; "cp_verify -key" on the key file's bytes in memory; only
//                      then key.bin, isk.txt and isk/anchor/hcnodes.bin
//   each leaf table k  phases A and L; "cp_verify -leaf" on the leaf file's bytes in memory; only
//                      then isk/leaf/<k>/ and ivk/leaf/<k>.bin
// Each configuration file is read once; the parsed bytes go to the worst-case check, the digest
// h_par (blk::configuration_digest()), isk/config and cp_verify. Later changes under -config have no effect.
//
// What wears out. Every opening of a weight table (the one-time test on the anchor, a LINK proof on
// both its tables, a batch of requests on its leaf table) sends some of the table's columns, and a
// row's masks are to hide only a limited number of opened columns (blocks/frame/configure.h,
// table_columns()). A table's count.bin counts them by its length, from an opening's start;
// cp_commit and the prover program cp_prove begin no opening that would take the count beyond the
// limit. The count is that directory's alone: a copy or a restored backup of isk has its own, which
// no program can detect (docs/operators-duties.md, "Backups and restored copies").
//
// The second form of the call (-leaves, -M or -first on an existing commitment: more leaf tables
// under the same anchor, or the oldest retired) is rejected [cp-commit-first-form-alone]: its code
// below reads a record from key.bin that the key file does not contain. rf::HfRecord, h_0,
// h_card and the check [own-test-hidden] belong to that record and enter no file or key. It is not
// phase A's record (blk::IndexRecord), which the second form leaves empty. Its rules:
//   - No one is to see two LINK proofs for one k. Each has its own private randomness, so none is
//     reused; but each opens its own columns of both tables and raises both counts. An attempt that
//     cp_verify rejects is written to no file; an accepted leaf file is stored in isk/leaf/<k>/
//     before it is published, and from then on that table is never generated again.
//   - A public stop (it depends on hash output alone: a failed nonce search, say) in a LINK proof
//     spends its number k for good: nothing of the attempt is released, and k is not tried again,
//     although a new attempt would have new private randomness. The rule is the operator's: no
//     program marks k. What a LINK proof reveals after stopped attempts has not been examined. The
//     operator sets -M k, and the next leaf tables begin after it (-first k + 1 with a larger -M).
//     In the first form, the only one accepted, a public stop while the key file or a leaf
//     file is generated voids the whole run for good: cp_commit ends with status 4 or by abort(),
//     and its cleanup removes both working directories, unless SIGKILL, any other signal that is
//     not caught, a crash or a power failure comes first. Nothing of the run is kept, retried or
//     published; the operator starts a new commitment, which samples a new seed (not with
//     -public-weights). This rule too is the operator's: beyond removing the files, no program
//     marks a void run.
//   - isk.txt is rewritten only at the end, and only if every leaf table from `first` to `M` - 1
//     (the live ones) exists, so cp_prove finds no isk.txt that names a live leaf table that is
//     missing; it would reject such an isk [cp-isk-leaves].
//   - cp_commit deletes nothing of a retired leaf table; cp_verify accepts its proofs forever. The
//     operator may remove its directory in isk once no cp_prove runs that was started under an
//     older isk.txt.
// The keys (derivations: prover/common/coin_keys.h; calls: prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_keys.h;
// the rule: docs/format/COIN-KEYS.md). A table's masks, its tree leaves' salts and its rows' pads
// come from its making key; the private randomness in the key file and in each leaf
// file, from a process key. Hiding rests on this: each table's key depends on bytes that are
// sampled for that generation of the table (the seed for the anchor, 32 bytes from the operating
// system for a leaf table). Two tables under one key would differ by codewords of the difference of
// their data, with no mask left. Only Make::a_copy and Make::the_first_table sample these bytes and
// can construct the MakersKey that make_the_table() and make_the_record() take. A process key takes
// 32 system bytes that are stored nowhere, except under -keep-for-the-audit. The public values that
// a key also hashes only guard against a system generator that repeats; no making key reads
// anything of the weights. So under a sampled seed only the anchor and its root are functions of
// (weights, configuration, seed) alone. Under -test-seed the system's bytes are zeros and every
// file repeats: nothing is hidden then. The same holds with -public-weights
// (prover/common/public_weights.h; production builds only), where the seed is derived from the
// option's file: whoever has that file can compute every mask. All keys are derived again by a
// second implementation (prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_derivation_check.cuh): the process keys are
// compared with its keys before a random value is sampled; every mask (only the first time that a
// table's generation computes it) and the salts of the tree leaves that an opening regenerates,
// with what it derives under its making keys, before a file's bytes leave.
//
// Exit status: 0 done; 1 the verifier's code rejects the configuration ("NO: <name>"); 2 rejected,
// or faulty input; 3 a tensor cannot be converted to integers; 4 an internal error, a stop while a
// file is generated, a leaf table's files gone at the end, or cp_verify's rejection of what this
// run generated; 5 a GPU fault; 6 the integers are not those of wsums.txt; 7 the worst-case check
// (below): not every bounded site fits; 16 a committed integer is out of range; 134 in a shell:
// abort(), which at a failed check in blocks/ or prover/engine/ (BLK_REQUIRE(), ENGINE_CK())
// follows a line "cp_commit: internal error (<name>): ..".
// Without -test-seed the log has times, public numbers, digests of public files and facts about the weights: whether
// the checks passed (if not, why); with wsums.txt, how many tensors have its sums; whether the embedding is wider than
// declared. It also has numbers that follow how the model files store their tensors, such as the host memory taken for them. The worst-case table, computed from the weights, goes only to -worst-case-table's file.
//
// The worst-case check. Whether a request's values leave a range depends on the weights, and such a
// request is answered "failed": on unchecked weights "failed" would be a bit about the weights at a
// prompt of the client's choice. When every bounded site (a range test of the forward pass) fits
// (what that shows and does not: prover/weights_commitment/worst_case.cuh), isk.txt gets the line
// "ranges <h_par>", which cp_prove requires. Only a call with -test-seed, which no production build
// has, can omit both: nothing is hidden, and isk.txt says "seed test": only test builds accept it.
