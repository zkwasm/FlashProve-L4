# Builds the GPU programs from the sources in this directory: cp_commit, which commits to a model's
# weights, cp_prove, which proves requests, and their test programs.
# Requires nvcc 13.2.86 (CUDA 13.2 Update 2), gcc and g++ 13, bash 4.4 or later, sed, awk,
# and GNU binutils, coreutils, findutils and grep. nvcc is looked up on PATH first and then in
# /usr/local/cuda/bin. Every target that runs nvcc first runs check_nvcc_version.sh, which explains
# the required version, and then compiles compiler_sample.cu and, if the machine has a GPU, runs it
# there for a moment. That run has no time limit: on a GPU that does not answer, the build waits.
# Building needs no GPU; the programs need an H100 (sm_90a) and an x86-64 CPU with the SHA
# extensions. The default build took 26 to 35 minutes on 11 or more cores in the few runs that were
# timed, none of them on an idle machine (prover/docs/build.md, "Build"). Before it calls this
# script, examples/quickstart-gpu.sh requires 10 GB of available memory, for this build, and 1 GB of
# free disk space in the repository.
# Build the verifier first (verifier/build.sh): cp_commit runs cp_verify, and its targets copy
# bin/cp_verify from the repository's top next to it. `serving` and serving_cp_commit require a
# cp_verify that was built from the present sources (from_these_sources()); the other targets do
# not check it. cp_prove needs no verifier.
#
#   ./build.sh [<target> [<argument>]]
#
#   serving      (the default) The production build (`serving` in names and messages): cp_prove and
#                cp_commit into $OUT/hc, with cp_verify. They have no test option and read
#                no test variable. Once cp_prove is about to read its first secret, it prints only a
#                fixed list of lines (`closed front`: prover/prover/closed_front.h). Each gets a
#                build record, <program>.build. <argument>: the commit that you state for this
#                tree, 7 to 64 hex digits; it is recorded as given.
#   serving_cp_prove, serving_cp_commit
#                one of the two. serving_cp_commit, if it succeeds, removes the cp_verify in
#                $OUT/hc, and only `serving` installs a new one there.
#   tests        The test build: cp_prove and cp_commit with the test options, into
#                $OUT/hc/test_build, and make_model, into $OUT.
#   cp_prove, cp_commit, make_model
#                one of the three; make_model is a CPU program that writes a small synthetic model
#                as GGUF files
# Every other target builds a test program or a benchmark, belongs to neither `serving` nor `tests`,
# and is described at its branch of the first case statement. Of all builds of cp_prove and
# cp_commit, and of programs that include their source, only the production build accepts a model's
# files.
# -h or --help, anywhere among the arguments, prints the usage message (status 0). A first argument
# that is no target gets it too, on standard error (status 2). In both cases nothing is created,
# checked or compiled.
# A script that sources this one can add targets of its own; sourced, this script rejects the
# serving targets. No script in this repository sources it. See more_targets, in the last branch
# of that case statement.
#
#   --field 2  accepted before the target, without effect: the only field is p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1
#   --dw 8     accepted for scripts that pass it; a digest always has 8 words
#   OUT        the output directory (`folder` in some messages), relative to this one; default:
#              build/. A named OUT that another account may be able to write in or replace is
#              rejected.
#   EIDB       22, 24 or 28: the build supports lookup identities of up to 2^EIDB keys (default 28)
#   ETAU       the random combinations in a sub-proof's approximate range check (`smallness` in
#              identifiers); default 128
#   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
#              set to the empty string, it keeps the build off the GPU: compiler_sample then finds
#              no GPU, and a message says that only the compiler's version was checked
#   FLASHPROVE_CUDA_ARCH  sm_89 for L4, or sm_90a (the default)
# EIDB and ETAU are explained in prover/common/setting.h. A serving target rejects them, and its
# compilers see only PATH of the caller's environment.
#
# A build writes only in OUT, which it creates if it is missing, with the directories above it (but in a target that is not a serving one, a variable of yours such as DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT can make g++ write elsewhere). Each
# call creates a new work directory there, building.XXXXXX. The compilers and this script write all
# their files into it, temporary files too. Only after every step and check has passed do renames
# give the target's files their names (the directories below OUT that receive them are created
# earlier). So a call that fails or is interrupted installs nothing and removes nothing that an
# earlier build left, unless one of these renames itself fails (see finish()). `serving` and `tests`
# call this script once for each program, and each call installs its own. So a `serving` or `tests`
# that fails or is interrupted may leave programs of two builds in OUT, and such a `serving` may
# leave no cp_verify in $OUT/hc: build again.
# Ctrl-C stops `serving`, the default, where env knows --default-signal (GNU coreutils 8.31 or
# later): its call for cp_prove runs in the background, where bash would have it ignore SIGINT, and
# is started through env with that signal set back to its default. Each call that still runs then
# installs nothing, unless it is already installing, and the script exits with status 130
# (prover/docs/build.md, "Build", has the trials). Not if this script was itself started with SIGINT
# ignored: then no call hears it. With an older env the call for cp_prove ignores SIGINT itself
# (see finish()); the compiler that it is running may still die of the signal, and then that call
# fails and installs nothing. Otherwise it goes on and, if it succeeds, installs cp_prove. The
# script waits for it, ignoring SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGTERM
# meanwhile, and then exits with status 130.
# This script sends no signal. So a signal that reaches only the process that runs `serving` or
# `tests` (`kill` with its process ID, not Ctrl-C) does not stop a call of this script that it has
# started: that call goes on and, if it succeeds, installs its program.
# A work directory can stay behind, as after SIGKILL; remove it once no build is running.
# A build removes only its work directory with the files in it, the files that its renames replace
# and, in serving_cp_commit, the earlier cp_verify in $OUT/hc. The installed files stay, and so does
# every other directory that a call created, even a call that failed. Run as root, or under sudo,
# the script creates all of them as root's.
