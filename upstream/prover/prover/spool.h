// Class Spool: the spool directory, through which requests reach the proving service (the prover
// program cp_prove with -spool) and responses leave it. CPU code only: it uses no GPU and does not
// interpret a proof's bytes. It also serves a single batch (cp_prove -in, -out): see below.
//
// Requests arrive as messages are delivered to a maildir: written and synced under a temporary name, then linked to
// their final names (D. J. Bernstein, "Using maildir format"; the manual page maildir(5), "How a message is
// delivered").
//   <spool>/in/<id>.req   A request (lay()): exactly T tokens, each a little-endian 32-bit word
//                         below the vocabulary size V; two more 32-bit words r and e, r < e <= T
//                         (the proof covers positions r to e - 1); and a nonce: 32 bytes from the
//                         system's random generator. <id>: the hash of these bytes (id_of_bytes()).
//   <spool>/work/<id>.req A request that a batch has taken (take()), until its response is on disk.
//   <spool>/out/          A response: <id>.y (the token file: one word) and then <id>.proof, or the
//                         empty file <id>.failed, which does not state the cause. Each file is
//                         written in full under out/.tmp/<id>/ ("staged") and then renamed to its
//                         final name ("named"). <id>.tag ("The tag", below) is created before the
//                         last file, so a response that has <id>.proof or <id>.failed is complete.
//   <spool>/stop          The operator's empty file: the service takes no further batch, removes
//                         the file and exits. Any other entry of that name ends the service too
//                         and is not removed; open() fails while it is there (stop_is_asked()).
//   <spool>/mark.txt      Says that this is a spool directory (check_mark()). The service writes it
//                         at its first start, unless a front end has done so before; nothing
//                         changes or removes it.
//
// Each request taken gets a response (one left in work/: "failed", staged by the next open()),
// unless read_request() says NOT_ITS_NAME in work/. A file in in/ whose id is in out/, out/.tmp/
// or work/ is removed unanswered when take() finds it with a batch slot free (`a_seat_is_left`).
//
// A file <64 hex digits>.req in in/ whose length is not a request's is left there: it may be
// another commitment's request, for which someone waits. So is one that the system does not let
// the service read (EACCES), until it does. One of the right length whose name is not the hash of
// its bytes is removed. Nothing appears in out/ under any of these names. So only someone who
// knows a request's bytes, nonce included, can compute its id. No one else can put a file in its
// place, create or wait for its response's files, or learn from a file of that name whether the
// request exists. The nonce appears in no proof and no file of a response; the tag depends on it.
//
// The directories are for the service's user only: open() fails if the spool directory or one of
// the five in it gives group or others any permission or is another user's (sudo: `typed_sudo`).
// Clients must reach them only through a front end, which this file does not provide. It must
// submit each request itself (lay()), record which client owns the id, and return a response's
// bytes to that owner only. It must show no one a listing of out/, a file's times, or anything
// about an id that is not theirs, and must remove the files of a delivered response.
//
// Release. release() gives the staged responses their final names at once, on the caller's thread.
// Nothing in cp_prove tests a finished proof: a response that is staged is released, and whoever
// hands it on must have verified it.
//
// The tag. <id>.tag is 32 bytes: an HMAC-SHA-256 of the id and the response's files, under a key
// derived from the request's nonce (tag_key_of(), tag_of()). A front end that keeps the key from
// lay() and compares the tag with the files that it is about to return detects a response that
// another account has put under the id. It must pass the tag to no client. Limits: the tag does not
// show that the proof is right, and does not help against anyone who can read the request's file.
// It covers the id and what was staged under it when release() read it. Staged directories swapped
// before that reading get valid tags, and nothing here guards against that. A response that is
// dropped before its release has no tag file. This class zeroes its copies of nonce and key.
//
// One process at a time serves a spool directory, holding locks on it and on out/ while it lives.
// After a kill or a power loss, out/.tmp/ can hold responses that were never released: the next
// open() zeroes and removes them, as does cp_prove -clear (clear()), which starts no service.
// No name or file here states a request's batch slot, its batch's number or the batch's other
// requests; but two proofs of one batch contain the number of the same leaf table (a further table
// of the same weights) and the same shared chain (which all its proofs repeat). A batch's responses
// are named together, in id order, failed or not; how long that takes depends on their number.
//
// Single batch (open_one_batch()): the requests are the files <name>.req of a directory that is
// only read, each exactly T + 2 words, without a nonce; <name> is the id. The responses are staged
// in .tmp of a new directory, or of one that a killed batch has left, which the process locks. No
// tags, no work/, no stop file. The first file in .tmp is a mark.txt of the kind "out", without which neither cp_prove -clear nor a later batch clears anything there.
// In identifiers, "settle" is syncing to disk, "answer" is a response and "lay" is submitting a
// request; "folder" (in messages too) is a directory.
