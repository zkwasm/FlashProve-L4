// How the prover program cp_prove uses isk, a commitment's secret key directory: start-up checks
// and a batch's start, which picks a leaf table and derives the batch's keys. A leaf table (`leaf`,
// `copy` in names and output) is a weight table (`Index` in names) with its own masks; isk.txt's
// `first` to `M` - 1 are live. cp_prove writes no file of isk but a leaf table's count.bin, whose
// length counts opened columns, and, with -keep-for-the-audit, audit/batch.fresh. [x]: a message's
// printed name. int results: 0, or nonzero after a message (read_the_seed(): one case without).
