// Decides whose turn it is in a batch pass, and tells the weight stream how far the batch pass has
// come. A batch pass (`Wave` in identifiers) is the part of a batch, at most -in-step requests,
// that the program cp_prove proves in one pass over the weights. A turn is one request's work on
// one layer group or on the output head: each request has its turn in a group before any goes on.
// Public source for this order: Sheng et al., "FlexGen", ICML 2023, arXiv:2303.06865,
// section 4.2, "Compute schedule".
// With NGr layer groups, a batch pass of n requests has NGr + 1 rounds of n turns. Round g < NGr is
// layer group g; the last round is the output head's sub-proof and each request's end. In every
// round the turns come in ascending order of `place`, a request's index within its batch pass. So
// requests start and end in the order of their slots; seat_begins() (prover/prover/in_step.cuh)
// ends the process on any other order of starts. The order of the turns depends only on n and NGr.
//
// With -overlap an earlier batch (a "rider"; with -overlap-two, up to two) may have an unfinished
// opening of the weight table. Each rider's opening then makes one of its passes over the weights
// (`walk` in identifiers) within this batch pass: it uses group g's loaded weights after turn
// folds_behind(n) of round g, the rest (embedding, output head) before the last round. If n = 1,
// that turn keeps the group's routed experts loaded, and the_rider_folds() releases their buffers.

// taking it back wait for the whole GPU (prover/weights_commitment/lent_memory.h), and so for all
// queued loads. After a round's first turn, loads into buffers released by the previous round, some
