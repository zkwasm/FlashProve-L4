// commitment's first weight table; no request is proved against it. Leaf table k (`leaf` in
// identifiers and file names) is a further weight table of the same weights with its own masks; it
// is not a leaf of a Merkle tree. The key file (key.bin) has the anchor's root and cp_commit's
// one-time proofs about the anchor. Leaf file k (`entry` in identifiers) has leaf table k's root
// and its LINK proof, which is meant to show that the table contains the anchor's weights.

// the same for every table. A batch opens `a_batch` columns. Both follow from the configuration
// files (Configured::table_columns() in blocks/frame/configure.h); the limit is written in no file.
// A table's count is the length of count.bin in its directory (isk/anchor or isk/leaf/<k>).
