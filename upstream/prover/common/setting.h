// BUILT_FOR_TESTS_ALONE is 1 in every build except the production build. Every other cp_commit and
// cp_prove, and every program that includes their sources, accepts the test options, and some of
// these builds drop a mask (a random value added to a sent value), send a false value or print
// hidden values, under the honest program's name. Where the macro is 1:
//   - the program rejects a model's weight files as soon as it knows which weights the run names
//     (`tests-build-on-a-model`: prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit.cu; read_isk(),
//     prover/prover/isk.cuh);
//   - its first lines of output and its line "setting:" say "for tests alone";
//   - the last line of cp_commit never says "can be handed out".
// The first of these is to keep every program that accepts a test option away from a model's weight
// files.
// On such files the test options would take the following away. Under -test-seed every mask, salt
// and pad follows from the file that the option names. So the key file (`ivk/key.bin`) and the leaf
// files (`ivk/leaf/<k>.bin`), which are derived from the weights, would hide the weights from no
// one who holds the option's file, and the same person could unmask each proof's opened columns.
// cp_commit's worst-case check of the weights would be skipped unless -worst-case or
// -worst-case-table asks for it.
// -test-bits accepts public files that a run at 128 bits (BAR, below) rejects: a lower target (line
// `sec`: the bits that the programs' error accounting must reach), against which the conditions for
// hiding are checked too; a parameter file outside the standard parameter form, such as one without
// the clamps (lines `rcl`, `gcl`); no layout.txt.
// -test-coins reads each batch's 32 random bytes from a file, and then nothing is hidden from
// whoever has that file.
// One option that is no test option writes to disk what hiding rests on, and the production builds
// of both programs accept it: -keep-for-the-audit. cp_commit keeps the 32 bytes of system
// randomness that went into the key file and into each leaf file; cp_prove keeps the 32 random
// bytes of its one batch. The bytes go into the subdirectory `audit` of the secret key directory
// (`isk`), for the audit with the secret key (tools/audit/README.md). With the seed
// (`isk/seed.bin`) they reveal every mask in those files and every mask, pad and salt of that
// batch's proofs. No macro restricts the option, only checks at run time. cp_commit rejects it on a
// model's weight files (`cp-commit-kept-on-a-model`: prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit.cu). So does
// cp_prove (`cp-prove-kept-on-a-model`: read_isk()), which also rejects it when run as a service
// (`cp-prove-kept-in-a-service`). With or without the option, cp_prove rejects a secret key
// directory whose `audit` is not empty or cannot be listed (`cp-kept-for-the-audit`: read_isk());
// that check sees that nothing is in `audit`, not that the audit has said YES: emptying `audit` by
// hand satisfies it. That nothing of the commitment and none of that batch's responses is handed
// out before the audit's YES is left to the operator (docs/operators-duties.md).
