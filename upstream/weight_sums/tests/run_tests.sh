# Builds bin/weight_sums and runs every test of weight_sums/. The two programs under test,
# bin/weight_sums (built from weight_sums/weight_sums.cpp) and weight_sums/weight_sums.py, each
# write a model's sums file: one line, with a SHA-256, for each committed tensor (a weight tensor
# that the committer program cp_commit commits to). The tests are described in
# weight_sums/README.md, "Tests".
# usage: weight_sums/tests/run_tests.sh [--keep] [--without-unit-test]
#   --keep               keeps the temporary folder
#   --without-unit-test  leaves out the step "unit" and counts it as skipped
# It can be called from any folder.
#
# It needs g++ 13 or later (tested with g++ 13.3.0 only), GNU coreutils, python3 3.9 or later on
# Linux 5.3 or later (weight_sums/tests/refusals.py calls os.pidfd_open) and about 0.6 GB of free
# space for its synthetic files. It takes a few minutes.
# Every input is a synthetic file that a test writes into a temporary folder, made where the
# environment variable TMPDIR says (by default in /tmp). The script refuses to run if another
# account may be able to replace what is made there, or to change a directory or symbolic link on
# the way: the comment at open_above() states the rule. The tests' temporary files go into the same
# folder, and so do the compiler's, except in weight_sums/build.sh, which keeps them in its own work
# folder. Without --keep the temporary folder is removed at the end, also after a failure, SIGINT or
# SIGTERM, but not after SIGKILL. Outside that folder the script leaves only bin/weight_sums, which
# replaces an earlier one, and a work folder bin/weight_sums.building.XXXXXX if SIGKILL ends
# weight_sums/build.sh or g++ leaves a temporary file there.
#
# The steps "model.cpp" and "model.py" need make_model, a test program of the prover
# (prover/tests/weights_blocks/make_model.cpp). If the environment variable MAKE_MODEL names a built
# make_model, that file is used. Otherwise it is built in the temporary folder. It runs on the CPU,
# which must have the SHA instructions of x86-64: on another CPU both steps fail.
#
# The steps that run weight_sums/weight_sums.py need numpy and gguf-py 0.19.0 (the llama.cpp
# project's Python package `gguf`), the only version that weight_sums.py accepts without
# --any-gguf-version. Where python3 does not have them, these steps are skipped. The other steps
# need no Python package.
#
# Each step prints one line: "passed: <step>", "failed: <step>" or "skipped: <step>: <reason>". The
# output of a failed step is printed above its line. A failed step does not end the run. The last
# line counts the failed steps, if any, and the skipped ones.
status_failed=1 # the exit status if a step failed, or this script's folders cannot be entered, or the temporary folder cannot be made

# The exit status is 0 if every step ran and passed.
