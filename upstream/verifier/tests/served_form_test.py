"""Checks, condition by condition, that cp_verify reports inputs not in the standard parameter form.

The standard parameter form (`served form` in names) is a list of conditions that a call must meet
to end with YES. They concern the call and the three configuration files: policy.txt (the parameter
file), KL.bin (the layers' quantization scales) and layout.txt (where a proof places each array).
The verifier cp_verify checks in three stages: key (the file key.bin), leaf (a file
leaf/<k>.bin) and request (the proof). A whole call, or a part-call (-key, -leaf: that stage only),
that misses a condition prints the condition's name and ends at best with NOT-A-VERIFICATION (exit
status 14). servedForm() (verifier/src/vf_common.h) lists the names of the conditions that the
request stage evaluates. The stages key and leaf evaluate one, two-codes, which the request stage
evaluates too. The stages key and leaf and the planning calls "request" and "accounting" print on
which bounds the proximity rounds (`closeness` in output) of a key file's and a leaf file's plan
rest ("accounting: one-time files: the plan of a key: .."). In every planning
case and every set of files the test checks that these lines are there. A whole call also evaluates id-named. In every mode the test first
compares SHORT below with the list in vf_common.h, so a condition that is added there fails this test.

Planning calls ("cp_verify -plan request") read no proof. They print the unmet conditions that the
configuration files decide: the request stage's. The cases change a configuration (`kit` in names and
messages; prover/tests/configurations/pinned meets every condition) so that one condition is not
met. "--list" prints every case with what it changes and what is expected, one of three results:
  - "not met: <names>": exit status 4 and the line "plan: not the standard parameter form (..): .."
    with those names and no other;
  - "the refusal <name>": exit status 1 and one line "NO: <name>": the verifier rejects the files;
  - "met": exit status 4 and no line "plan: not ..": a control, which changes the same values and
    violates nothing (the case none.kit changes nothing).
Conditions without a case in which that condition alone is not met:
  - routed-experts: the verifier accepts the digest lines of the four public tables all or none,
    and rejects them unless the model has routed experts (policy-tables). So table-digests is not
    met either. Without routed experts it also rejects the clamps' lines rcl
    and gcl, so both-clamps is not met either. Cases show the three rejections;
  - prompt-source, three-bytes: the verifier rejects the files of their cases;
  - placement-table: without a layout file the planning call is rejected (plan-layout).
Two parts of rotary-table have no case: lt (log2 of a request's tokens) at most 10, dh (a head's
dimension) at most 128. one-placement is tested on the residual stream only: in
prover/tests/configurations/pinned/layout.txt the first block of attention's input spans two rows,
and no two of its blocks have the same first row and length, so exchanged() and halved() do not
apply to it.

A planning call does not show what the stages key and leaf themselves print. A part-call prints the
causes of NOT-A-VERIFICATION only after its file has passed, so this takes honest files made under
changed parameters: the sets (`world` in names and messages) that the_worlds() lists.
  --bend writes the three configuration files of such a set, for a committer and a prover to work
    under; "cp_verify -plan accounting" on them must end with status 4.
  --world checks the files that they made; <ivk folder> is the commitment's public key directory.
    The part-calls -key and -leaf (on leaf/0.bin), and the whole call if the last three arguments
    are given, must each end NOT-A-VERIFICATION with exactly the set's conditions as the stage's
    causes, or pass if the set has none. The two part-calls must also print their line
    "accounting: one-time files:".
    The whole call's line "commitment:" must end with the clause on a record (RECORDCLAUSE in
    verifier/src/vf_common.h), and its line "result-v1" have the field record=1.
    The set `kit` changes nothing and must pass: the positive control.
The other sets miss two-codes. SUITE.md runs --world on the set `kit` only.
The set `record` is a second run of the control, on the files of the row that names it.
The conditions on a whole call's request and options (next-token, exact-match, policy-named,
id-named) have no case here: none of this test's planning calls can miss them.
