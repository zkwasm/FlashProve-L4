# Builds the verifier, cp_verify, from verifier/src/cp_verify.cpp. Needs g++ 13 or later, GNU
# coreutils and findutils, about two minutes and 1.6 GB of memory; no GPU.
# The program goes into bin/ at the checkout's top, or into the directory given after "-"
# (`<output folder>` in the usage text; a relative path starts at the caller's working directory).
# A cp_verify that is already there is overwritten, with a notice on stderr; a build that fails or
# is interrupted leaves it unchanged. The script builds nothing in a given directory that another
# account could tamper with (open_above()), whose parent is missing or whose path has a newline.
# It compiles in a work directory of its own, cp_verify.building.XXXXXX in the output directory,
# which is also the compiler's TMPDIR. It removes only that work directory, and itself writes
# nothing outside the output directory. The compiler gets the caller's environment without seven
# variables that can name a file for it to append to (see "; unset" below); the rest of that
# environment, PATH included, can still tell it to write elsewhere. What can stay besides
# cp_verify: an output directory that the script created, even if nothing is built; and the work
# directory, if the compiler left a temporary file in it, if the script's check right after
# creating it fails (it cannot be examined, is not empty or is no longer the same directory), or
# if the script is killed before finish() runs, as by SIGKILL. No later run removes or needs it.
# The script sends no signal: the compiler runs on if the script alone is killed, and a SIGTERM or
# SIGHUP sent to the script alone while it compiles takes effect only when the compiler has ended.
#   --field  accepts only 2 and changes nothing: there is one field, p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1, number 2.
#   --clang  compiles with clang++ (only 18.1.3 has been tried), for comparison with the g++ build
#            (verifier/tests/clang_build_test.sh). The output directory must then be given, so that
#            this build does not replace the g++ build in the default directory by accident.
#            Figures and test runs in this repository use the g++ build unless they say otherwise.
