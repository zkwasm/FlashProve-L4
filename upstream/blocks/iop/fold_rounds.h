// The rounds of the sumcheck FOLD as arithmetic over a field: the values in the prover's messages
// and the claims that follow from them. fold.h adds oracle messages, hashing and bytes. The field K is a template
// parameter, as in hp.h, so that tests can run the prover's code exhaustively over a tiny field.
//
// FOLD starts from one linear claim on a group of 2^k main rows m, 2^h mask rows mu (rows of
// random values; h <= k) and kept rows m_j, which are not among the 2^k and are not folded (see
// fold_kept_factor()). With coefficient vectors c, d and c_j, the claim is
//       < c, m > + < d, mu > + V = target,        V = sum_j < c_j, m_j >.
// Its summand in the k row variables, with a challenge eps and a hiding polynomial U (hp.h), is
//       H(X) = U(X) + eps * ( < c(X), m(X) > + < d(X_1..X_h), mu(X_1..X_h) > * X_{h+1} * .. * X_k
//                             + (1 - X_1) * .. * (1 - X_k) * V ),
// where c(X), m(X), .. are the rows folded at X (fold_algebra.h). A fresh mask of 2^h rows holds
// U's coefficients. FOLD ends with one new linear claim on the kept rows and on three single rows:
// m folded at the challenges g_1..g_k, and mu and the fresh mask, each folded at g_1..g_h.
// Order that soundness needs and the caller must keep (nothing here checks it): the fresh mask and
// the sum of U are sent before eps is known; each round's polynomial before that round's challenge.
//
// Follows the construction of the zero-knowledge sumcheck IOR, with the two-coefficient rounds of the
// complete zero-knowledge IOPP, of the paper that this protocol builds on (see THIRD_PARTY.md).
