// SEND, a block of the protocol. The prover sends oracle messages: main rows (data) and mask rows
// (random values), each row encoded as a codeword; the proof has the roots of their Merkle trees.
// The verifier replies with the seed (a point z and a scalar beta) of an out-of-domain sample. The
// prover begins its next message with one answer for each oracle message: the value of a linear
// form, which the seed fixes, on the entire message that the oracle message encodes. This is to pin
// one message for each oracle message (explained at `Send`). The coordinates of z, beta and the
// answers are in E, the cubic extension of the field F. An oracle message whose
// OracleShape::answers (blocks/iop/relation.h) is s gets s answers, under s seeds; one with 0 is
// sent but not sampled. A call in which every oracle message has 0 answers ends the process
// ("send: nothing to sample"): such messages are sent alone, with send_oracles() and
// receive_oracles().
// Callers use send_prove() and send_verify(). Code that fills a table for send_prove() leaves 0 in
// the pad's entries (`place` in identifiers and messages, but for two local variables of that name,
// which hold the position inside the row); the pad is the random element that masks an answer
// (Send::pad()).
//
// Errors. SEND has two rounds (one, if the caller closes the answers' round: `AnswersRound`).
//    The error of the seed's round is the sum over the sampled oracle
//    messages of (L^2 / 2) * e. L bounds the number of codewords within the test's distance of any
//    word (blocks/numbers/codes.h); a is the dimension of the message's cube (`SampleCube`). The
//    factor L^2 / 2, a union over pairs, is Lemma 9.1 of Chiesa, Fenzi, Weissenberg, "Zero-knowledge IOPPs
//    for constrained interleaved codes" (ePrint 2026/391, version of February 25, 2026), proved there.
//    e = max(a / |E|, 1 / (|E| - 1)) bounds the chance that the form is 0 on a fixed non-zero
//    difference of two messages, by a short argument, which this file's writer wrote down itself:
//    if they differ in the answer's pad, at most one beta fits each z;
//    else, if they differ outside the pads, that part of
//    the form is a non-zero multilinear polynomial in z.
//    (The form is a variant of Lemma 9.3 there (ePrint 2026/391, version of February 25, 2026), which gives the same bound by the same two cases, for one answer.) With s
//    answers, which have s independent seeds and pads, e is taken to the power s: if they differ in pads
//    alone, the form of an answer whose pad differs is beta times the difference, never 0. The round of the answers,
//    after which the verifier's message is empty: 0 (with AnswersRound::OWN; else the caller closes
//    that round, with a message and an error of its own).
//    Computed by plan_send(), blocks/numbers/blocks.h.
//
// Follows the lemma on out-of-domain samples and, for the pad under beta and the bound e, the lemma
// on private zero-evaders and the complete zero-knowledge IOPP, of
// the paper that this protocol builds on (see THIRD_PARTY.md).

// Why a sample. Beyond half the minimum distance a committed word can be close to several
// codewords, and a prover could argue from one of them in one place and from another elsewhere. For
// all but a small fraction of the seeds, two different messages near one word give different
// answers, and the seed is drawn after the word is fixed. So from the answer on, "the message of
// this oracle message" is one definite thing: that of the nearest codeword, within the distance of
// its later proximity test, that agrees with the answer.
// SEND itself does not check that an answer is right. It keeps the equation form(message) = answer
// as a linear claim (`Row` in identifiers), the sample claim, in the `Statement`, the public state
// that both sides keep (blocks/iop/relation.h). Statement::begin_run() passes it to every proximity
// test on the oracle message.
//
// Orders that must hold, and what keeps them (tested by blocks/iop/tests/send_orders_test.cpp):
//   - Oracle message, then seed, then answer: send_prove() and send_verify() do the three steps in
//     one call.
//   - The seed shares its verifier's message with nothing: no positions, and no point at which
//     something will be folded and compared with the answer. A prover that knows such a point
//     before it answers can fit the answer to any nearby codeword. The channel is the object
//     through which a block sends and receives (blocks/chain/rounds.h). The handle that its
//     close_seed() returns can draw only seeds: a program that asks it for more does not compile.
//   - Nothing is drawn between seed and answers: the channel accepts only the answers at the start
//     of the next message. An answer that is kept out of the hash chain (the Fiat-Shamir
//     transcript), to be chosen later, is rejected (the test of this, on synthetic data with a
//     malicious prover, is not part of this repository).
//   - Before its answers are sent, an oracle message joins no group (the oracle messages that one
//     proximity test reads), no claim on it enters a group, and none of its mask entries is given
//     out. All three need the mark "sampled", which only `Send` can set (`SendAccess`), and it does
//     so last. Statement::sampled_elsewhere() copies a mark that `Send` has set in another
//     statement; it compares only the two shapes and codes, not the roots.
//
// Further tests in blocks/iop/tests/: send_form_test.cpp (the form, entry by entry, against its
// definition); send_bat_split_test.cpp (honest prover against verifier). Malicious provers that
// give a wrong answer, or a wrong answer and then pads altered to fit it, belong to tests that are
// not part of this repository. Another such test commits to a word close to two codewords: the
// sample pins one.

// in the body).
// Send::prove() draws no pad: after a bare send_oracles() (blocks/iop/context.h) it would answer
// with the pads as they were.
// A pad that is never drawn is 0; the answer, which is in the proof, is then an unmasked linear
// form of the message; and no verifier and no test on a proof can notice. Only own-test-pad-kept
// does, and only inside send_prove(). So tests read the entries in the prover's memory
// (pads_fault()). This project's forms of blocks/iop/tests/send_pad_test.cpp for a sender that draws
// no pad, and for one that draws one value and writes it to every entry of every pad, pass only if
// send_verify(), the only verifier in that test, accepts; they are not part of this repository.
// The random tail of every row (random coefficients that are encoded with its entries) must cover
// all positions at which all tests together open it. open_oracles() (blocks/iop/context.h) counts
// them for each tree and ends the process if there are more. Two contexts share a tree's count only
// if one took the tree over by TreeBook::adopt().

  // at the draw (`laid.of`) and, if the generator numbers its draws, with the draw computed a
  // second time from its number. A pad that was lost, or written to a neighbouring entry, leaves an
  // answer of the message unmasked in a proof that verifies. The pads' indices are computed again,
  // from the shape in the statement, so a sampled message for which no pad was drawn fails too. The
  // GPU engine's own check after a write (write_entries(), prover/engine/engine_gpu.cuh) reads at
  // the address to which it has written, so it cannot see a wrong address. This check draws nothing
  // and sends nothing.
  // It comes after send_oracles(), not right after set_entries(), so that it also sees a pad that
  // was lost while the message was encoded and committed: it reads the tables from which every
  // later answer is computed. Nothing has left the process at either point.
  // Not seen:
  //   - a pad that is overwritten after this check and before the answer is computed (the answer is
  //     then unmasked, but the proof does not verify);
  //   - with a generator that does not number its draws, a value lost right after its draw, before
  //     the copy is taken: the copy and the table then hold the same value;
  //   - a fault in the formula of Send::pad(), which gives the index both for the write and for the
  //     reading back: only the engine's address is computed twice. (This does little harm:
  //     Send::form() takes the index from the same function, for prover and verifier, and an index
  //     that pointed at non-zero data would fail own-test-pad-place.)
  //   - a value that is drawn once and used again (this project's test build of such a sender,
  //     which records no draw's number and is not part of this repository, passes);

// verifies and hides less.
// Not seen: a value lost in the copies that send_oracles() passes to the engine, which are made
// before this check, or in their encoding, from which the symbols at opened positions are taken.
// Not compared: the pad's entries, which send_prove() fills with draws of their own and checks
// itself (own-test-pad-kept).
// open_oracles() (blocks/iop/context.h) calls this check on every message with mask rows that it
// opens (own-test-mask-rows), so an opened message's tail is compared at least there, except in a
// context that did not send the message (lin_second_prove_on_shape(), blocks/iop/lin.h).
// The result is 0 also where nothing is compared, and nothing reports that. The mask table is
// compared only if the code that drew it recorded the draw's number in OracleDraft::mask_draw: only
// make_key_under() (blocks/frame/check_key.h), wf_rows_prove() (blocks/iop/wf.h), lin_draft()
// (blocks/iop/lin.h) and base_mask_make() with base_mask_draft() (blocks/iop/base_case.h) do; the
// callers of Send::fresh_mask() in blocks/iop/foldeq.h, blocks/iop/req.h and blocks/iop/rng.h do
// not: of their messages only the tail is compared, when they are opened. In cp_commit and cp_prove
// no sent message keeps a table that one of these three has drawn: the folded row has no mask rows
// (blocks/frame/lin_frame.h, blocks/iop/link.h), rng_prove() has no caller, and cp_prove puts a row
// of its own in place of the table that ReqProver::first() draws (prover/prover/chain_run.cuh). If
// a program comes to send a message that keeps such a table, the code that drew it must record the
// draw's number, and ReqProver::first() must clear it where it replaces the table. Where this check
// is called on a fold mask's message, only the tail is compared: the table is made from several
// draws, which FOLD compares itself (fold_mask_as_drawn(), blocks/iop/fold.h).
// send_oracles() records the number of the tail's draw. Neither table is compared with a generator
// that gives its draws no number (Coins::NO_DRAW). A program that relies on this check must itself
// require a generator that numbers its draws.
// The committer program cp_commit does so after make_key(), before a byte of the key file leaves
// the process (prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit_once.cuh:
// "the key file's coins are not the program's own generator"), and in the same way for a leaf file
// (`entry` in identifiers and messages; prover/hash_commitment/hf_entry_make.cuh). The prover
// program cp_prove does so for a request's generator at the draw of the request's index-mask
// message (prover/prover/chain_frame.cuh), which it compares in its own code
// (prover/prover/chain_run.cuh). It also does so for a request's and the batch's generators before
// bytes of a proof leave the process (coins_hold(), prover/prover/chain_coins.cuh). Without these
// tests a result of 0 shows nothing.
