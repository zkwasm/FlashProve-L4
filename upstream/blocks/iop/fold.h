// FOLD, a sumcheck with a hiding polynomial, reduces one linear claim (`GroupRow`, relation.h) on
// the rows of a group to one on three single rows. A group is the oracle messages (its members:
// encoded rows, sent as Merkle roots) that one proximity test reads at one list of positions.
// From: 2^k main rows (messages m) under one code, 2^h mask rows (short, for masks; messages mu)
//       under the mask code, h <= k; unfilled rows are zero. Claim: < c, m > + < d, mu > = target.
// To:   `SingleRows` (single_rows.h): the main rows folded at g_1..g_k, the mask rows and a fresh
//       mask (`FoldMask`) folded at g_1..g_h; one linear claim on their messages.
// Kept rows, the main rows of a member that `GroupLayout` marks as kept, are not among the 2^k
// rows and are not folded; both claims may have terms on them (`KeptForm`): see fold_output().
// Messages (P: prover, V: verifier; the arithmetic is in fold_rounds.h):
//   P  the fresh mask, unless it was sent before; the sum over {0,1}^k of its hiding polynomial U
//   V  eps, one element: the sumcheck runs on U + eps * (the claim's summand)
//   k times:  P  the constant and the quadratic coefficient of the round's polynomial;   V  g_j
// The verifier tests no equation here. A prover that departs from the committed rows is left, up to
// the rounds' errors, with a claim that is false for them; the blocks after FOLD are to reject it.
//
// Follows the construction of the zero-knowledge sumcheck IOR and, for two-coefficient rounds and a mask sent early,
// the complete zero-knowledge IOPP, of the paper that this protocol builds on (see THIRD_PARTY.md).
