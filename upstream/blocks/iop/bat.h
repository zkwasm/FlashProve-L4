// BAT batches J linear claims into one: the sum of x^i times claim number i, counted from 0, for a
// challenge x. A linear claim (`Row` in identifiers, "row" in error texts) states that a linear
// form of the messages encoded in some oracle messages (codeword rows sent as Merkle roots) has a
// public value (`target`). The prover sends nothing; the verifier sends x, one element of the
// extension field `E`. BAT has no check. Nothing is sent, so hiding needs nothing.
//
// Every claim, its value included, must be fixed before x is drawn (one exception: the first
// combine() below). Before it draws x, the channel, which derives challenges by hashing, absorbs
// what the prover has sent. The code that makes a claim must ensure, unchecked here, that its value
// depends only on the statement, on what was sent and on earlier challenges.
//
// Error: if some claim fails for a given tuple of messages, so does the sum, except for at most
// J - 1 values of x (a non-zero polynomial of degree below J). The bounds at run() and sigma() are
// elementary; the batched form is Definition 5.6 of Chiesa, Fenzi, Weissenberg, "Zero-knowledge
// IOPPs for constrained interleaved codes" (ePrint 2026/391, version of February 25, 2026), and the
// step is part of the proof of their code switch.
//
// The batched row follows the definition of the batched linear form of
// the paper that this protocol builds on
// (see THIRD_PARTY.md).

  // is to pin one message for each oracle message). Each claim is about these pinned messages.
  // Statement::begin_run() in blocks/iop/relation.h numbers them: `PLAIN` claims as added; then
  // the sample claims, oracle message by oracle message as sent; then `GENERATOR` claims (a
  // codeword's symbol at an opened position) as added.
  // After: one claim on the whole group (`GroupRow`), of which the test shows only that some
  // codeword near the group's word meets it. The sample claims inside it tie that codeword to the
  // pinned messages, so callers do not supply them: begin_run() returns all of them with the rest.
  // In the controls of `send_two_codewords_test` and `split_two_masks_test`, a claim taken without
  // the sample claims holds for a second codeword near the word, one that disagrees with the
  // sample's answer. These two tests are not part of this repository.
  // begin_run() closes g: after it a new claim or oracle message for g, a second test on g, or
  // taking a mask entry of its oracle messages ends the process.
