// Gives out the entries of an oracle message's mask rows so that each is used once.
//
// An oracle message (relation.h) is a set of encoded main rows and mask rows sent in one prover
// message. Its mask rows hold uniform elements of the challenge field (exceptions: see
// `MaskLedger`, and fold_mask_table() in fold_algebra.h). A protocol block that sends a scalar
// which depends on the witness adds one such entry to it. Hiding rests on three rules:
//   1. An entry masks only one sent scalar.
//   2. An entry is used only after its oracle message's out-of-domain sample has been answered.
//   3. An entry is used before the first proximity test on a group containing its oracle message
//      (a group: oracle messages tested together).
// The types here make the straightforward ways to break a rule fail to compile or stop the program.
// Those under "Not caught" at the classes below are not stopped: avoiding them is the caller's
// duty. No honest run reveals such a fault: both sides make the same calls and every linear claim
// (`Row` in relation.h) stays true; what is lost is hiding.

// Not caught: reading a slot's numbers does not use it up, so a prover's code can add one entry to
// two scalars. A linear claim can refer to a mask entry by its number, without a slot. A slot that
// was taken in time can still be used after MaskLedger::close().
