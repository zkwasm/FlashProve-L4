// Domain-separation numbers for H(tag, index, start; bytes) of blocks/hash/hash.h. Each use of the
// hash has a separate number: the tag's low 16 bits, so the first two bytes of the hashed string.
// The number alone decides if a hash has a start, a digest that sets its initial state
// (domain_has_start()).
// Another hash in this repository has numbers of its own (blocks/hash/older.h uses some): within
// 3 to 139, and 240 and 241; listed in verifier/HASHES.md, "The numbers that the sources pass".
// To keep one meaning per number across both hashes, stay in 160 to 239.
// No number is reused: 161, 163, 165, 167, 170 and 175 are retired. Add new numbers at the end.

// A chain is a hash chain: the Fiat-Shamir transcript of one protocol (blocks/chain/chain.h); its

// CHAIN_START. A run is one execution of a chain. The configuration digest is a hash of the public
// configuration files.
// The table of uses, with index, start and bytes: docs/format/FORMAT.md, R3.1.
// PUBLISHED_ID is computed by published_id() in blocks/frame/heads.h. A commitment holds the
// weights as one table and may store further copies of it. The anchor is the first table
// (`first_table_name` in published_id()); its record's answers are stored answers to samples of its
// rows at the record's seeds.
// For a proof, the inputs under COIN_INPUTS must cover all that the prover's messages depend on;
// `CoinInputs` (blocks/coins/run_coins.h) hashes whatever its caller adds. For the private coins of
// a commitment's table the inputs are public facts, nothing of the weights: lists::first_table()
// and lists::copy_table() in prover/common/coin_keys.h.
