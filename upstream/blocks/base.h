// Callback that a program can set, to run before a failed guard aborts the process. If it is null,
// as in the program `cp_verify`, a failed guard prints its line to stderr and calls abort().
// Two programs set it. The prover program `cp_prove` (arm_ends() in prover/prover/ends.h) sets one
// that calls stop(), which runs that program's wipe of its secrets, then exits. `cp_commit`, which
// commits to the weights (cp_commit_program() in prover/hash_commitment/hf_commit.cu), sets one
// that prints a line to stderr with `name` (see below), or "failed-check" if `name` is null, and
// returns.
// The callback runs on the failing thread, after the guard's line, outside any signal handler. If
// it returns, abort() follows. It may be entered from several threads at once, and must take no
// lock that a thread can hold at a guard. It cannot throw: the pointer's type is noexcept (tested
// by blocks/tests/must_not_build/a_guards_hook_that_may_throw.cpp), as are the two functions below,
// so that no exception leaves a failed guard for a caller that might catch it and continue.
// A translation unit that is linked with its symbols made local has its own copy of this variable,
// null until assigned. In `cp_prove`, the units that own the weight table get the pointer at set-up
// (hf_keeper_unit() in prover/hash_commitment/hf_keeper.cu); the verifier's unit
// (verifier/src/cp_verify.cpp) does not, so a guard that fails there calls abort()
// without the wipe.
// `name`: null, a guard's name (see BLK_REQUIRE_NAMED) or "cuda-call" (prover/engine/device.cuh);
// a string literal. Only the callback receives it: where this pointer is null, the name is unused.
// `cp_prove` prints it in its last line, because its production build redirects stderr to
// /dev/null (close() in prover/prover/closed_front.h). Being an argument, it reaches the program's
// callback from every unit whose own copy of this pointer has been assigned.

// Host code only.
// BLK_REQUIRE_NAMED(cond, name, text): the same with a name, for the few self-checks that protect
// private random values: a value compared with what was drawn or written, a place that must be
// empty before its draw, a generator's self-test. Their names begin "own-test-": after such a name
// `cp_prove` exits with status 9 (prover/prover/ends.h). The name tells an operator that one of
// these self-checks has failed: the machine or the program may lose or repeat private random
// values. Find the cause before restarting it.
// Some guards stop a prover that would give secrets away in proofs that every verifier accepts.
// Without such a guard a run could complete, the verifier could accept, and a proof could
// distinguish two witnesses.
// Some of these guards are in the verifier's program too: at a layout
// that would leak (the layout is public: which oracle messages share a tree's leaves, and at which
// lists of positions each is read), it stops and gives no verdict; without the guard it would go on
// and give one. If the rule above is kept, no guard depends on a proof's bytes, and wherever a
// verifier gives a verdict, it is the one that it would give without the guard.
