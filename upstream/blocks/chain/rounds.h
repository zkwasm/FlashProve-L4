//
// send..() writes an item into the proof and into the chain's next query. recv..() reads the item,
// rejects it if it is not in canonical form, and puts it into the verifier's own next query. A

//   close_epsilon()    one element of E         close_bits()       matrix entries in {-1, 0, 1}
//   close_seed()       seeds of samples         close_empty()      nothing
// seal() ends a chain with a digest, for a protocol of several chains. A mistake of the calling
// program (a call out of order, a round that differs from the plan) ends the process; whatever

// elements, positions and matrix entries. A round's bits of proof of work are the plan's too. So
// the rounds that run agree in name, kind, counts and work with the planned rounds, whose error
// bounds the plan lists. How far those bounds are tied to the numbers on which a block runs: see
// require_rows(). Not compared with the plan: the bytes written through file_only(), and how a

// Rejection (`refuse` in identifiers and messages). Whatever depends on a proof's bytes makes the
// verifier's calls return false and never ends the process. The rejection is permanent: ok() stays
// false (a prover's ok() is always true), and the channel reads nothing more, leaves the chain
// alone and checks neither the plan nor the order of calls. Every recv..() then fails and gives
// zeros, and every draw gives a fixed value (0; 1 for an element that must not be 0; for positions
// one draw, the position 0). So a verifier's function may return at once or run on: finish() is
// false in either case. A function that runs on must take the number of positions from the list,
// never from a number of its own, so that lists, openings and loops still agree in size. A block
