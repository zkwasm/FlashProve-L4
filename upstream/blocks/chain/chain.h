// The Fiat-Shamir hash chain: hash outputs replace the verifier's messages of one interactive
// protocol. A round may require proof of work (`work_bits` bits): a nonce found by search.
//
// A query is an input to the hash; its answer is the output. A chain has one 32-byte value, rho.
// Its first value is the answer to the first query (`FirstQuery`), which fixes label, parameters,
// statement and any salt before the prover speaks. Round i makes one query,
//     (the chain's label, rho_{i-1}, i; the prover's message of the round, Merkle roots included;
//      the kind of the verifier's message and the round's `work_bits`; nonce_i, 0 without work),
// whose answer gives rho_i and the verifier's message. A round whose verifier's message is empty
// makes its query too, so every prover message enters a query. A query contains the entire previous
// value, so anyone who knows rho_i has made every query before it. A proof contains nothing of a
// chain but its salt (if `salt_in_proof`) and its nonces: no rho_i, no digest of a round.
//
// rounds.h, not this file, enforces which draws a round may make and in which order messages come.
