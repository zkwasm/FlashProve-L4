// The state that the hash chains of one checked file share on the verifier's side: a session.
//
// The check of a file ends in one verdict and may run several hash chains (blocks/chain/chain.h: a
// chain is the Fiat-Shamir transcript of one interactive protocol). A proof file has its request's
// first chain, the chain that its batch shares, and its second chain; a key file (`ivk/key.bin`)
// also has three; a leaf file (`ivk/leaf/<k>.bin`) has one. Each check (check_proof(),
// check_key_under() and check_entry_under() in blocks/frame/) constructs one VerifierSession and
// passes it to each of its chains' channels (VerifierRounds, blocks/chain/rounds.h: the object that
// runs one chain); the session must outlive these channels. It holds a record of digests for each
// Merkle root against which an opening is checked (record()), and each chain's outcome, from which
// accepted() gives the verdict. A chain that follows another (Binder::follows(),
// blocks/chain/public.h) must be in that chain's session, or the constructor of VerifierRounds ends
// the process.
//
// A session lives inside one process. `cp_verify` checks the three files in three processes, each
// with a session of its own: no record reaches from one file's check to another's. Stated in
// docs/format/FORMAT.md, "17.2 Where this page and the programs are known to differ", item 4.
