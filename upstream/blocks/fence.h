// Keeps macros (`switch` in messages) that are only for tests out of production builds (`SERVING`
// in macro names). Some test macros let a test disable checks, choose the private randomness
// (`COINS` in macro names) or call functions that only a test may call. Programs outside blocks/
// compile its headers too, and one such macro in a production build would make a prover that leaks
// or a verifier that is no verifier. So: (1) the list below leads to one macro,
// BLK_NOT_FOR_SERVING; (2) BLK_NOT_FOR_SERVING does not compile with SERVING_BUILD, which a
// production build must define, as prover/build.sh and verifier/build.sh do; (3) a program built
// under BLK_NOT_FOR_SERVING contains the string of BLK_MARK_NOT_FOR_SERVING(), which a build script
// can search for, as prover/build.sh does. Two of the three messages below still speak of a
// cheating prover: the code that makes the honest prover malicious, for tests, is not part of this
// repository.

// The list sees only macros defined on the command line or before this file is first included

// reports a missing one only if named BLK_CHEAT_.., BLK_TEST_.., BLK_.._FOR_A_TEST,
// BLK_.._FOR_TESTS_ONLY or BLK_.._HIDE_NOTHING.

// blocks/code/cosets.h defines BLK_CODE_FOR_TESTS_ONLY only after this file, if
// BLK_GL64_SUBGROUP_LOG is not 32, so this list tests that value itself.
