// Engine is the interface to a prover's heavy steps: those whose cost grows with the size of the
// main rows (storing and encoding tables, Merkle trees, inner products, folds) and the nonce
// search. The prover functions of blocks/iop/ decide on the host what is sent and in which order,
// do the small arithmetic, and call an Engine for the rest. EngineCpu (blocks/engine/engine_cpu.h)
// is the reference implementation; EngineGpu (prover/engine/engine_gpu.cuh) has the same calls.
//
// An oracle message (defined in blocks/iop/relation.h) has main rows under one base code and mask
// rows under one mask code. A row's random tail is Code::r entries of private randomness (`Coins`)
// encoded with its message. The engine stores main rows in main tables and draws and keeps their
// tails. Mask rows are short and stay on the host: the caller passes in their messages and tails.
//
// Lifetimes: an engine need not copy what it reads. A main table must outlive every tree committed
// over it; a tree must outlive every fold over its rows; a table that a fold's coefficient vector
// refers to must outlive that fold. EngineCpu ends the process on an earlier drop() or close().
// "Ends the process" means a failed BLK_REQUIRE (blocks/base.h): a line on stderr and no return.
