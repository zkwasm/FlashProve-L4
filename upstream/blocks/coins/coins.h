// The prover's private randomness (`coin` in identifiers and messages): random tails of encoded
// rows, mask rows, pads, hiding polynomials, and the salts of tree leaves and hash chains. Keys are
// derived from a secret seed; under such a key StreamCoinsT implements `Coins`
// (blocks/engine/table.h). The only cryptographic primitive that the code here calls is f, the
// ChaCha20 block function (blocks/coins/chacha.h). The hash of chains and trees enters only through
// the digests that process_key() and making_key() take in: CoinInputs (blocks/coins/run_coins.h)
// makes them with that hash, under a domain-separation number of its own, Domain::COIN_INPUTS.
// No verifier and no proof sees how these values are made. Soundness assumes nothing of them;
// hiding depends on them, and no verifier can check them. Hiding requires:
//   1. The seed is uniform, secret and used for nothing else; keys derived from it are as secret.
//      A key's holder must wipe it after use: CoinKey.
//   2. Under one key no label (a value's name) is used twice with different inputs: process_key().
//   3. Under a run's process key no context (one proof or message) is used twice: CoinContext.
//   4. A committed table's lasting values come from a secret drawn at its creation: making_key().
//   5. f is a pseudo-random function: with derived values hiding is computational at best.
// Tests: blocks/coins/tests/coins_test.cpp (f itself on RFC 8439's vector, in rfc_vector(); keys,
// contexts, words and elements on values of blocks/coins/tests/coin_values.py, which derives them
// again in Python and cannot show a fault in f that it shares; rejected words, real and forced;
