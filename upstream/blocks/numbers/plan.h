/* The plan of one protocol run: every round with its error bound (`priced` in names and messages)
   and proof of work, and every message with its size, in protocol order.

   A planner (a `plan_..` function of blocks/numbers/blocks.h) appends the rounds and messages of
   one block (a step of the proof system, such as SEND or FOLD) from the block's sizes. Prover and
   verifier then step through the list with a `Cursor`: the channel (blocks/chain/rounds.h) takes
   each round's proof of work from its entry and ends the process if the round that runs differs from the next
   planned one in name, kind or counts (bytes sent, values drawn). A planning call (such as the verifier program
   `cp_verify` with `-plan`) plans by the same routines and runs nothing. What it prints joins the chains into
   one plan and, without `-fields`, may list equal rounds once, with a count: its lines are not a run's rounds.

   Whether an error bound was computed from the numbers on which a block really runs is checked only
   where the block compares them (`PricedGroup`, `PricedTable`, `PlanRound`); `Priced` marks the
   rounds whose bound rests on a number that nothing checks. The types here guard against mistakes,
   not against a caller who sets out to defeat them ("Two types", below). */

/* Two types. Planners write into a `Plan`; `Plan::finish` makes a read-only `Planned` of it;
   whatever runs, checks or prints a plan takes a `Planned`. The types guard against mistakes, not
   against a caller who sets out to defeat them: what binds a malicious prover is what `cp_verify`
   derives from the public files.

   In a source that uses these headers as they are meant, the compiler enforces that only the
   planners in the first friend list of `MayLay` (blocks/numbers/blocks.h) add a round with a
   verifier's message and compute its bound, that a finished plan does not change, and that rounds,
   setting and verdict stay together. (Through the second list anyone can add a prover's message, a
   round with an empty verifier's message or, by `plan_chain`, the rounds of a finished plan.)
   Tested by blocks/numbers/tests/plan_types_test.cpp and by sources in
   blocks/tests/must_not_build/, which the compiler must reject.

   In its own process a caller can get round this, and no C++ type stops it.
   Known ways:
   - a macro defined before these headers, or access checks switched off;
   - a cast or its equivalent on an object of these types (a union, memcpy, placement new, a
     destructor called by name);
   - a dangling reference: one kept beyond its object's lifetime, such as one into a std::variant
     whose alternative is then replaced. The C++ standard leaves its use undefined;
   - an explicit instantiation or specialisation of any template, the caller's own too, over a
     private name (template struct X<&Plan::enter>: access is not checked there);
   - a declaration in blk, std or at global scope before these headers: that overload is preferred
     inside a planner. prover/ and verifier/ declare names in namespace blk themselves; only code
     review guards that;
   - BLK_PLANS_BY_HAND_FOR_A_TEST (see `Plan`). It does not compile in a unit built with
     SERVING_BUILD, as `cp_verify` and the production build are. The plain targets `cp_prove` and
     `cp_commit` (the prover and committer programs) of prover/build.sh are not: there the script
     does not install a finished program that contains the marker string of blocks/fence.h;
   - code of the caller's that runs in the middle of a planner (a replaced global operator new, a
     second thread) and writes an object that the planner took by reference.
   Read once (`READ ONCE` in blocks/numbers/blocks.h): against the last way, because it is cheap,
   every listed planner copies each of its sizes once (not its label `where`, which enters no
   bound), so that a round's bound and what is stated with it come from one object, and a round
   enters the plan complete. A copy that allocates memory is not made in one step: a list is copied
   entry by entry, a struct member by member. So the caller's code can change the original in the
   middle of the copy, which then has the earlier parts unchanged and the later ones changed. That
   is an object that the caller could have passed in, and the bound and what is stated with it still
   come from the copy alone (docs/limits-all-rows.tsv, row T2.2).
   The copying does not cover the functions that run a proof, which take shapes, keys and readers by
   reference; the unlisted planners (`plan_iopp`, a `.._plan` function of blocks/frame/), which
   pass one object of their caller's to several listed ones; or the plan's scope, which is read
   separately for the factor `Setting::instances` in a round's bound, for its `scope` and for its
   `work_bits`. These are examples, not a complete list.
   blocks/numbers/tests/planners_read_once_test.cpp tests the copying in part;
   of the planners' 22 copies it cannot notice four, which its head names.

   Every caller chooses the setting, the planners' arguments and order, the part, scope and repeat,
   `compact`, `refuse` and when to `finish`; it can write on a copy of a `Plan`, and `plan_chain`
   puts a finished plan's rounds before, after or under a repeat of other rounds. These choices are
   checked only where a block compares at the run, and by the frames (the headers of blocks/frame/),
   which derive all of them from the public files except what a sub-proof's planner adds, which the
   program passes in. */
