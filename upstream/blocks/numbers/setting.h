                point and a pad factor
     POSITIONS  positions of a code: uniform, independent, with repetition; in the code switch (CS),
                then one element of E
     BITS       a matrix with entries in {-1, 0, 1}, for the approximate range check (RNG)
     SEAL       nothing for the protocol: one more query, which ends a chain and binds all of it in
                one digest, for the first query of a chain that follows it
     RECORD     the seeds of a committed table's own samples, drawn on a separate chain whose
                statement is the table's name; not a round of the plan's chain
     EMPTY      nothing. The round still makes its query, which takes in the prover's message. */

                where one applies

     CLOSENESS  the proximity term: a combination of words is close to the code although the words
                are not jointly close (mutual correlated agreement); the only kind that can rest on
                the cited bound up to the Johnson radius (see `CountSource`)
     QUERY      a word that is far from what is claimed agrees with it at all drawn positions
     SMALL      the range check's error: a vector that is not small has small images under all drawn
                combinations

/* Which bound gives the count of exceptional challenges in a CLOSENESS error, the best-founded
   first. codes.h describes each. JOHNSON, the cited bound on mutual correlated agreement up to the
   Johnson radius, is taken as given. It is Theorem 4.6, taken with M = 1, of IACR ePrint report
   2025/2055 as posted on 6 November 2025 (a paper on proximity gaps of Reed-Solomon codes; authors
   Ben-Sasson, Carmon, Haböck, Kopparty and Saraf). It has an integer m >= 3 that ties the slack
   eta = 1 - sqrt(rho) - gamma to the size of the bound (gamma: the distance, delta in codes.h). The
   programs take m as the theorem prints it: m = max(ceil(sqrt(rho) / eta), 3). The same paper's
   Theorem 1.5 and page 24 have sqrt(rho) / (2 eta), and so has Theorem 4.12 of IACR ePrint report
   2026/680 (a survey of open problems on list decoding and correlated agreement; authors Arnon,
   Boneh and Fenzi). The printed form is the weaker reading: at a given slack its m, and so its
   bound, is never smaller.

   A combination of the rows of an interleaved word costs as much in a CLOSENESS error as a line
   through two words: an interleaved Reed-Solomon code is a Reed-Solomon code over a larger field on
   the same domain, and the cited bound counts exceptional challenges without regard to the field.
   That is our own short argument, unrefereed. Lemma 4.7 of ePrint 2026/680 has the number of rows
   times that; the programs do not use it. */
