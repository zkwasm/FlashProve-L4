       the mask code's length), to the main length n.
       WITHIN A THIRD of the distance the count is that of a lemma of the paper that this protocol
       builds on (codes.h: THIRD; proved there) for any linear code, at the long length.
       Beyond a third the argument is this. The count, as codes.h defines it, and
       how long a list is, depend only on the code as a set of words, not on how its n positions
       are numbered. Under a numbering chosen for the proof the repeated words are polynomials in
       X^t on the subgroup of order n: a subcode of the Reed-Solomon code of degree at most
       t (d - 1) there (d: the mask code's dimension), whose reduced rate (d - 1) / n_zk is the
       mask code's own. So the term is the count of the theorem on codes, taken as given (codes.h:
       JOHNSON), at length n and that rate, plus one list size for the step to a subcode, which is
       added also where the two lengths are equal.
       Not claimed, and not true: that under the format's copy map and the main code's own
       numbering a repeated word is in a Reed-Solomon code on the main domain.
       The count requires of the format: one public copy map under which every short position has t
       copies; a coset as the short code's domain; n dividing p - 1; a distance below the mask
       code's own Johnson radius; mask symbols combined and compared with mask symbols only; symbols combined position by position only; a code that is linear over E.
       The term enters twice in each round j <= h of a fold, once in BASE's first round
       (`fold_round_error`, `base_error`), and in no other round.
       The group's list size goes by the smaller of the two minimum distances: it is the larger of
