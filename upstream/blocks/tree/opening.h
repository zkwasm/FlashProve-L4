// A Merkle tree over codewords (rows) sent in one prover message: a leaf's content, an opening's
// bytes, the verifier's check, and the CPU prover's tree. blocks/tree/tree.h has the vertices above
// the leaves. The verifier gets the root first and later reads the rows at a list of positions,
// from an opening. On a bad opening, read_opening(), check_opening() and receive_opening() return
// false; BLK_REQUIRE (blocks/base.h) is for the program's own mistakes and ends the process.
//   - Main rows have length n = 2^log_n and are read at a position x. Mask rows, of random values,
//     have length n_zk = 2^log_n_zk <= n and are read at the short position of x, x mod n_zk:
//     short_position() in blocks/code/short_position.h.
//   - The leaf of position x holds the column at x, then a salt, and is opened in full. The column
//     is the symbols at x of all main rows, part by part (OracleTreeShape), row by row, an element
//     of the extension field as its coordinates in order; then, in the same order, all mask rows'
//     symbols at the short position of x. So a mask row's symbol is copied into n / n_zk leaves.
//   - A tree of mask rows only has log_n = log_n_zk: its column at x is their symbols at x.
//   - Nothing here makes the copies of a mask symbol agree: two opened positions over one short
//     position each show their own.
